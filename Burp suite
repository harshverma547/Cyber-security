Exciting Update!

I'm thrilled to share that l've completed my #tasho as a Cyber Security & Ethical hacking Intern at #technohacksedutechs, focused on enhancing my skills with Burp-suite! During this incredible journey, l've delved into the world of web application security and penetration testing using the powerful burpsuite tool. My time as an intern has been a fantastic opportunity to gain hands-on experience, refine my technical abilities, and contribute to enhancing the security posture of digital landscapes.
